The program defines a class 'ParsingTable' with a dictionary of production rules. It also has a method 'parse' that takes an input string and uses the production rules to determine if the string is a valid arithmetic expression. The method prints the input string, stack, and production rule used for each step in the parsing process, and returns True if the input string is valid, False otherwise. The program prompts the user for input, creates an instance of 'ParsingTable', calls the 'parse' method with the input string and an end-of-string marker, and prints whether the string is accepted or not.
